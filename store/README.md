# STORE

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your Vuex Store files.
Vuex Store option is implemented in the Nuxt.js framework.

Creating a file in this directory automatically activates the option in the framework.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/vuex-store).
### Routing
- We can create new route with folder, file
- Ex: Creating a new user folder and then inside, creating a file index.vue
- So we can path: localhost:3000/user -> going to : index page of user folder
