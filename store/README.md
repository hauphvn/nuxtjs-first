## Routing
- We can create new route with folder, file
- Ex: Creating a new user folder and then inside, creating a file index.vue
- So we can path: localhost:3000/user -> going to : index page of user folder


- Sub routing:
- Inside a folder: we create a new file vue: _somethingId.vue
- And then we're going to path: localhost:3000/user/something -> going to: _somethingId.vue page


- Another way: we can folder approach:
- We create a sub folder: _id inside user folder and then creating a index.vue file inside _id folder
- The result as the same.
